					<description><![CDATA[With the new year, I&#039;m yet further bummed that your missing poof is still AWOL.  Hope can last only so long -- what about personal responsibility to do the right thing and return it?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing&#039;s for sure:  That ain&#039;t no way to treat a lady, or a sparkle poof, soma, or the Flaming Lotus Girls, who have provided such a service in amazing art now for years on end.  I hope it turns up, returned and in good shape, one way or the other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your creation was the highlight of our burn this year.  In fact, we spent the night of the burn underneath your structure with friends sprawled out on a blanket.  Seems that each night we kept finding out way back to Soma.  My thanks for your efforts and best hopes that your equipment is returned without delay.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read this a couple of minutes ago, and although I did not attend this year&#039;s Burn, The Flaming Lotus Girls&#039; creations were big highlights for my 06 and 07 Burns.  Boo to foulplay and poor citizenry... yay for The Flaming Lotus Girls and their continued creations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s complete bull-puckies that anyone would take that poof.  I hope it finds it&#039;s way back home.  I, for one, always look forward to seeing the latest creation from the Flaming Lotus Girls.  Thank you for your continued love, energy and sheer will that you bring to the playa in the form of your gorgeous art, it is VERY appreciated.]]></description>
